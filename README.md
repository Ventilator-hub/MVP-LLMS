# MVP-LLMS: Optimizing Intervention Timing and Subsequent Decision Support for Mechanical Ventilation Parameter Control Using Large Language Models
## Data Preparation

The datasets we have constructed are all sourced from patient data within real ICU wards, which include some information that is sensitive in terms of privacy and policy. To ensure data security and prevent its use for purposes beyond academic research, we are currently not fully opening our dataset. If you are interested in conducting academic research and wish to access our dataset, please submit a detailed application, which should cover your institutional background, research motivations, and specific uses. The application should be sent to: m320123343@sues.edu.cn. We look forward to collaborating with you in the academic field to jointly promote the scientific application of medical data.
